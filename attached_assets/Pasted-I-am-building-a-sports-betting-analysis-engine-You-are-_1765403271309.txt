I am building a sports betting analysis engine. You are my coding assistant and will write 100% of the code. I cannot code, so I need clear instructions and working code.

Create a new Python project with the following structure and behaviour:

PROJECT GOAL:
Build a backend service that:
1. Ingests historical and upcoming data for UFC, NBA, NFL, NRL and Tennis.
2. Ingests current betting odds from available public sources (for testing, use mock data or a simple free API).
3. Runs a probability + expected value (EV) model using historical stats and market odds.
4. Produces a list of high-confidence, high-value betting legs for each sport.
5. Provides an API endpoint that returns:
    - recommended legs
    - confidence rating
    - value rating
    - suggested multi targeting around $2 odds
6. Includes a super simple web UI (HTML/JS only) that displays the recommended legs.

PROJECT STRUCTURE (create these folders + files):

/app
    __init__.py
    main.py              # FastAPI entry point
    config.py            # API keys, settings
    utils.py             # shared helpers

/app/data_sources
    __init__.py
    ufc.py
    nba.py
    nfl.py
    nrl.py
    tennis.py
    odds_api.py          # handles odds ingestion from API or mock data

/app/models
    __init__.py
    probability.py       # implied probability, model prediction
    expected_value.py    # EV calculation and selection logic

/app/services
    __init__.py
    analyzer.py          # central logic: combine data & produce recommended legs
    multi_builder.py     # builds a parlay aiming for approx $2 odds

/app/ui
    index.html
    script.js
    styles.css

ROOT FILES:
requirements.txt         # include fastapi, uvicorn, pandas, requests, numpy
README.md                # basic usage instructions

INITIAL FUNCTIONALITY TO IMPLEMENT NOW:
1. A FastAPI backend running at / (root) with a health check.
2. A /value-bets endpoint that returns a mock list of recommended bets.
3. A basic EV formula:
      implied_prob = 1 / decimal_odds
      ev = (model_prob * decimal_odds) - 1
4. A placeholder prediction model that returns static probabilities until we add real data.
5. A simple HTML page served at /ui that fetches /value-bets and displays the results.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Generate the entire project structure.
- Write working code in each file.
- Make sure the project runs immediately without errors.
- Use mock data for now; we will add real APIs later.
- Explain briefly how to run it.

Start now by generating the project folder structure and initial working codebase.
