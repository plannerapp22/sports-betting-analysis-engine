The rationale should:

Quote specific, real stats fetched by the engine (e.g. “8 of last 10”, “+7.5 point differential”, “ranked #3 offense vs #22 defense”).

Optionally mention context like:

Home vs away records.

Recent form.

Head-to-head trends (if they support the selection).

Any known narrative risk that was considered and judged acceptable.

Make it clear that this is model-based analysis, not a guarantee.

Ensure the /value-bets API now returns:

All numeric fields (probabilities, EV, odds).

The rationale text.

Any confidence label (“HIGH”, and possibly “MEDIUM” internally even if not shown).

========================
F. UI & DEPLOYMENT

Update /app/ui/index.html and /app/ui/script.js so that the frontend:

Calls the updated /value-bets endpoint.

Displays the 10–12 recommended legs in a table:

Columns: sport, event, selection, odds, implied probability, model probability, EV, confidence, rationale.

Shows when the data was last updated (timestamp).

Optionally allows filtering by sport.

Ensure the app is served in a way suitable for deployment:

Confirm that main.py exposes the FastAPI app correctly.

Ensure requirements.txt includes everything needed (fastapi, uvicorn, requests, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, sqlalchemy, etc.).

Provide me with clear, non-technical steps to deploy/publish this app publicly from Replit, using the built-in Replit hosting:

I want to be able to share a public URL where the /ui page can be visited by anyone.

========================
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

I cannot code, so:

Update all necessary files yourself.

Keep the code clean and well-commented.

After each major change, ensure the app still runs without errors.

Explain briefly what you changed and how to run or retrain the model.

If a particular external API requires an API key, show me:

Where to put it (e.g., in config.py).

How to set it securely in Replit.

Start now by:

Proposing specific sports data APIs and odds providers you will use.

Implementing the odds + data integrations.

Then wiring up the database, ML model, analyzer (with the 40 → 12 pruning logic and rationales), UI, and deployment steps as described.
